# Lung Cancer Detection Using Transfer Learning Models

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive deep learning solution for **lung cancer detection** using transfer learning on CT scan images. We evaluated **eight different pre-trained transfer learning models** to identify the one achieving the highest accuracy and optimal performance metrics.

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Chest CT Scan Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images)

---

## 🧠 Models Evaluated

The following transfer learning architectures were compared:

1. **ConvNext** - Latest generation convolutional neural networks
2. **EfficientNetB0** - Efficient and scalable CNN architecture
3. **VGG-16** - Classical deep CNN architecture
4. ResNet variants
5. MobileNet
6. InceptionV3
7. DenseNet
8. Xception

Each model was trained and validated on the chest CT scan dataset to compare accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores.
